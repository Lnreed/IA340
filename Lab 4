both are fine, but the apprach in class was better, then the one given in chat GBT. Nothing is considered perfect in this case it is not but it's funtional.

when i ask chat gbt it gave me this code 
# Initialize Census API (use your API key)
c = Census("YOUR_CENSUS_API_KEY")

# Get income data for all states (ACS5 survey for median household income)
income_data = c.acs5.state(('NAME', 'B19013_001E'), Census.ALL)

# Convert to a DataFrame for easy processing
df = pd.DataFrame(income_data)

# Rename columns for clarity
df.columns = ['State', 'Median_Income', 'State_FIPS']

# Find the state with the highest income
highest_income_state = df.loc[df['Median_Income'].idxmax()]

# Display the result
print(f"The state with the highest median income is {highest_income_state['State']} with an income of ${highest_income_state['Median_Income']}.")
state with the highest income is washington DC
yes the sql data works
4.7 Prompt:
-- Write an SQL query to calculate the annual population growth rate for Virginia (VA) over the past five years.
-- Assume you have a table named 'population_data' with columns 'state', 'year', and 'population'.
-- The growth rate should be calculated as the percentage change in population from year to year.

-- SQL Code:
WITH population_changes AS (
    SELECT 
        year,
        population,
        LAG(population) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS previous_population
    FROM population_data
    WHERE state = 'VA'
    AND year BETWEEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 5 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 1
)
SELECT 
    year,
    population,
    previous_population,
    ((population - previous_population) / previous_population) * 100 AS growth_rate_percentage
FROM population_changes
WHERE previous_population IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY year;
*/ no I did not modify it, but yes it does work.

*/ no Chat GBT does not always give you the accurate answer, you must be specific on what you want from it
