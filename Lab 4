CREATE TABLE states (
    fips CHAR(2) PRIMARY KEY,    -- FIPS codes are typically 2 characters long
    state_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL -- State name with a max length of 50 characters
);
CREATE TABLE state_population (
    fips CHAR(2),                        -- Foreign key referring to states table
    year INT,                            -- Year for the population data
    population BIGINT,                   -- Population count (large number)
    PRIMARY KEY (fips, year),            -- Composite primary key (ensures no duplicate entries for a state and year)
    FOREIGN KEY (fips) REFERENCES states(fips)  -- Enforces referential integrity
);
both are fine, but the apprach in class was better, then the one given in chat GBT. Nothing is considered perfect in this case it is not but it's funtional.
